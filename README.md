# Jupyter notebooks

This repository contains some jupyter notebooks from my data science projects. The LaTeX rendering is nicer if you download and view the notebooks locally.

* `Edward_notebook_public.ipynb` discusses Bayesian neural networks and is related to a [blog post](https://qvik.com/news/data-science-bayesian-neural-networks-edward/).

* `Stock price modelling for the mathematically curious.ipynb` is a short mathematical introduction to a certain stochastic differential equation and is related to an upcoming blog post.

* `Gordon's theorem.ipynb` demonstrates dimensionality reduction by comparing Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma with Gordon's theorem.

* `Erdos-Renyi random graphs.ipynb` contains some numerical demonstrations of properties of random graphs.
