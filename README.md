# Jupyter notebooks

This repository contains some jupyter notebooks from my data science projects. The LaTeX rendering is nicer if you view the notebooks locally or on [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) (links provided below).

* `Basic regression with Gaussian Processes.ipynb` is a short and simple introduction on how to use Gaussian Processes for regression problems. [View on nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mikkokemppainen/Jupyter_notebooks/blob/master/Basic%20regression%20with%20Gaussian%20Processes.ipynb).

* `Edward_notebook_public.ipynb` discusses Bayesian neural networks and is related to a [blog post](https://qvik.com/news/data-science-bayesian-neural-networks-edward/). [View on nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mikkokemppainen/Jupyter_notebooks/blob/master/Edward_notebook_public.ipynb).

* `Erdos-Renyi random graphs.ipynb` contains some numerical demonstrations of properties of random graphs. [View on nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mikkokemppainen/Jupyter_notebooks/blob/master/Erdos-Renyi%20random%20graphs.ipynb).

* `Gordon's theorem.ipynb` demonstrates dimensionality reduction by comparing Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma with Gordon's theorem. [View on nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mikkokemppainen/Jupyter_notebooks/blob/master/Gordon%27s%20theorem.ipynb).
