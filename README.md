# Jupyter notebooks

This repository contains some jupyter notebooks from my data science projects. The LaTeX rendering is nicer if you view the notebooks locally or on [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) (links provided below).

* `Edward_notebook_public.ipynb` discusses Bayesian neural networks and is related to a [blog post](https://qvik.com/news/data-science-bayesian-neural-networks-edward/). [View on nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mikkokemppainen/Jupyter_notebooks/blob/master/Edward_notebook_public.ipynb).

* `Stock price modelling for the mathematically curious.ipynb` is a short mathematical introduction to a certain stochastic differential equation and is related to an upcoming blog post.
